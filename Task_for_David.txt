Your task will be to enhance the tracker system you previously developed

	////DONE////

	1 *Record the date and time when the interaction occured:
		-store year, month and day.
		-store hour, minute, second and milisecond.
		-best format is store like this: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_gettime.asp
			-there should be conversions from that type into readable date
			-needed for easier sorting if such a thing will be needed.

	////DONE////

	2 *Record following interactions with the system:
		-Clicking:
			-What buttons does user press
			-What "interactables" does he press
				e.g. a piture with methods on them

			looked into doesnt work as its by html class which would end up being probably more code than just adding event listener
			(Design wise - what if we add a classname "listened" the elements we want to listen?  Read this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19655189/javascript-click-event-listener-on-class )

		-System responses:
			-Ones user does something, system may respond.  I would like to know the following responces:
				-Page transitions (e.g. transitioned to homepage)
				-Server communications (e.g. sign in successful)
	////DONE////
		-User entering and leaving the site.
	////DONE////

	***in on close method read in variable from my sql
	***add to variable with current array
	***push variable back up

	3 *Save the logs into the DB in the User's Table.
		-There will be a large "variable" which stores a log per user.
		-I want you to get the original log and append a new log to it.

	////DONE/////
		Log structure should have the following structure.
			*log.dateAndTime
			*log.type            //Based on interaction which made the recording.
			*log.content         //a variable (like JSON) which has interaction related data

		Logs (note "s") can be an array which stores a log.
	////DONE////


		bigger variable type
-Content can vary depending on what your tracker detected.  It can be an element ID, server message, leaving page.
